# tangerine-language
A project to create a unique programming language by [CONFIDENTIAL] and [CONFIDENTIAL]. The files are based in C++. We may accept requests to change or add fetures to Tangerine, but there is no guarantee that these features will be integrated quickly, if so at all. Tangerine was designed on Ubuntu, and thus it may not work on another distribution of Linux or any other OS.
